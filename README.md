# 🐍 Python Top 1% Roadmap


**A curated, structured roadmap to master Python like a top 1% developer.**  
From core syntax to advanced internals, design patterns, problem solving, real-world libraries, and deployment—this roadmap guides you through everything you need to become an expert Pythonista.




## 📘 Overview


This repository outlines a **comprehensive Python learning roadmap**, organized by topics and concepts. It is designed for:

- Aspiring Python developers
- Experienced coders looking to deepen their Python expertise
- Interview preparation (system design, algorithms, Python internals)
- Educators and mentors building Python curriculam


Whether you're self-studying or mentoring others, this roadmap provides the structure and depth needed to master both foundational and advanced Python concepts.




## 🧭 Roadmap Topics

### 1\. Python Core & Syntax

- Zen of Python (PEP 20)
- Variables, data types, dynamic typing
- Operators, expressions, input/output
- String interpolation, formatting, encoding

### 2\. Control Structures

- Conditionals, loops, control flow
- Comprehensions
- Exception handling and custom exceptions

### 3\. Functions & Functional Programming

- Functions, arguments, scopes
- Lambda, map/filter/reduce
- Closures, decorators, \*args, \*\*kwargs

### 4\. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) & Design Patterns

- Classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism
- Dunder methods, static/class methods, properties
- Abstract base classes, interfaces
- Design patterns: Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.

### 5\. Data Structures

- Built-in types (list, dict, set, tuple, frozenset)
- `collections` module (namedtuple, Counter, defaultdict, deque)
- Custom structures: stacks, queues, trees, graphs

### 6\. File I/O & Serialization

- File handling (text/binary)
- Context managers
- Working with CSV, JSON, Pickle, YAML
- OS operations (`os`, `glob`, `pathlib`)

### 7\. Algorithms & Problem Solving

- Searching, sorting
- Recursion, dynamic programming
- Big-O complexity
- Real-world algorithms (e.g., diffing, pattern matching)

### 8\. Modules, Packages & Environments

- Python import system
- Virtual environments (venv, pipenv, poetry)
- Dependency management
- Writing reusable modules and packages

### 9\. Advanced Python Internals

- Iterators, generators, descriptors
- Metaclasses
- Memory management, GIL
- Asyncio, multithreading, multiprocessing
- Reflection and introspection

### 10\. Testing & Debugging

- Unit testing with `unittest`, `pytest`
- Mocking, fixtures
- Logging, assertions
- Profiling and debugging tools

### 11\. Development Tools & Best Practices

- Linters, formatters (`flake8`, `black`)
- Type hints and static typing (`mypy`, PEP 484)
- Documentation tools (Sphinx, docstrings)
- Project structure and code organization
- Pythonic idioms and anti-patterns

### 12\. Useful Libraries & Real-World Topics

- **Data**: NumPy, pandas
- **Web**: Flask, FastAPI, Django basics
- **Automation**: requests, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, pyautogui
- **CLI tools**: argparse, click
- **Concurrency**: asyncio, threading, multiprocessing
- **Deployment**: packaging, Docker, pipx, wheel, pex



## 📂 Repository Structure

> *Coming Soon* – In future updates, this repository may include:

- Code examples for each topic
- Cheatsheets and reference guides
- Real-world mini-projects
- Practice exercises and problems



## 🚀 Getting Started

You can use this roadmap in multiple ways:

- As a **checklist** for your own learning
- As a **teaching tool** or reference for mentoring others
- To **prepare for technical interviews** or Python certifications
- To **structure content for blog posts, videos, or courses**
