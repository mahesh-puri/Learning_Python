## What Makes Python Unique?

Python is a **high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose** programming language. It is known for its **simple and readable syntax** —something that looks and feels almost like plain English. Because of this, Python is often considered one of the **easiest languages to learn**, especially for beginners.

Python supports **multiple programming styles** such as:

- **Object-oriented programming**
- **Procedural programming**
- **Functional programming**

This flexibility makes it suitable for different types of projects.

It also comes with a **huge standard library** and thousands of **third-party modules**. This means you can do a lot without writing everything from scratch—whether you’re working on a web app, analysing data, or building a machine learning model.
